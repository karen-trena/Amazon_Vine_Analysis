# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:
The purspose is to determine if thereÂ´s any type of bias among reviews such that Vine members favor the scores of reviews over other type of reviews.

I used the video games list of reviews from Amazon in the US,but any list could have been used from this [site](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/index.txt).

I used PySpark to connect to AWS RDS and send finished data to PgAdmin.

## Results: 
* How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
We had 94 non-paid reviews and 40471 paid reviews as shown in the image:
